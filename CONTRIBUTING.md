# ** Welcome to contributions page! **

Let's help you submit your first Pull Request.

For this exercise you'll be adding a new entry to the  source code with your profile details. Excited?  let's begin!

## **Step 1**

Go to the GitHub repository of this project and fork the project to your account. Click  on the fork button on the top right corner of the repository page to do it. Once done, GitHub will take you to the forked copy in your account.

## **Step 2**

Clone  the forked repository to your local machine. Click on the big green  button saying "Clone or download" and copy the https url of your repository. Fire up the terminal (on Linux systems ctrl+alt+t and on Windows open the Git-bash ) navigate to your desired directory and type the following command.  Replace the link with the clone URL of your repository and hit Enter.

    git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME>/ClassJava

## **Step 3**

Let's start working on the changes required now! First Change directory into the cloned folder by typing the following command.

    cd ClassJava
    cd contributions

Before jumping in to the code, make sure you're working on a different  branch and not in master. To create a new branch, from the terminal  inside your current project directory type the following command.

    git branch <YOUR_USERNAME-profile>

Replace the YOUR_USERNAME with your GitHub username or you can give any name to your branch which  describes the purpose of the branch. Since here we're adding your  profile, we'll simply give the name of the branch as above. eg: git branch name-profile.  Once you have created the new branch we'll change the current branch  from master to your newly created branch. Execute the following command  on your terminal.

    git checkout <YOUR_BRANCH_NAME>


## **Step 4**

In your  file manager/terminal navigate to the downloaded repo. Open the sub-directory src/profiles/. and create a new .md file with your username as the filename with .md extension.
It should look like YOUR_USER_NAME.md  eg: kapish33.md
Open this file in your favorite editor and fill the details as below in the front matter of the markdown file.


Add your profile page - YOUR_USER_NAME.md

    ---
    username: <YOUR_USER_NAME>
    fullname: <YOUR_FULL_NAME>
    ---

Do not forget that the hyphens "---" are also part of the file. Once you finish adding the content, save the file.

## **Step 5**

Commit the changes with a suitable commit message. First we need to stage all the changes we made. Open the terminal inside the project directory and execute following commands.

    git add -A

The above command stages all the changes, now lets commit it with a suitable message.

    git commit -m "YOUR_COMMIT_MESSAGE"


## **Step 6**

Let's push the changes to your repository! execute the following command to push all the changes to the forked copy in your GitHub account.

    git push -u origin YOUR_BRANCH_NAME

## **Step 7**

Now, open your web browser and go to the original repository on GitHub.  If your changes has been pushed to your forked copy, You'll be able to  see an option saying "New Pull Request" in the original repository.  Click on the option, one next page choose the master branch of the main repository against your created-branch name (choose that branch name which you created and not master). Then click on create pull request. Once you fill  in the commit message and comment click on submit pull request.

Finally you are all done!  Wait for a reviewer to review your file and merge it to the master.
